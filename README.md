This repository contains a small project that demonstrates how to draw a burger using only HTML and CSS. The focus of this project is to create a responsive burger icon by utilizing percentage-based dimensions.

## Techniques Used for Responsiveness

To ensure that the burger icon remains responsive across various screen sizes, the following techniques were employed:

1. **Percentage Width and Height**: The key to achieving responsiveness lies in using percentage-based width and height values for the different components of the burger. By using percentages, the size of the burger adjusts proportionally as the viewport dimensions change.

2. **Flexbox Layout**: Flexbox was employed to arrange the burger components (bun, patty, lettuce, etc.) in a structured manner.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This HTML file contains the structure of the burger, including the necessary HTML elements for the bun, patty, and other components.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styling rules for the burger components. It includes the percentage-based width and height settings, coloring, as well as the flexbox layout properties.
- `animations.css`: This file contains animation properties when hovering over the burger.

## Usage

To view the responsive burger icon, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can also explore the CSS files to understand how the responsiveness is achieved using percentage-based sizing and flexbox layout.

**Note**: media queries can be used, but for simplicity I preferred to use percentage based dimensions.
